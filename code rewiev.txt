Code Review for Foxy Radio Selection App
The Foxy Radio Selection App is a simple GUI application that allows users to search for radio stations based on genre and 
play them. Here are some positive aspects of the code:
Libraries and APIs
The code imports the necessary libraries and APIs for the application to function properly. The libraries used are 
requests, geocoder, tkinter, webbrowser, and datetime. The OpenWeatherMap API is used to retrieve the current weather 
information.
Functions
The code is well-organized and uses functions to perform specific tasks. The functions are:

get_stations_by_genre: Retrieves radio stations based on the provided genre.
play_station: Opens the provided URL to play the radio station.
search_stations: Searches for radio stations based on the entered genre.
clear_genre_entry: Clears the genre entry field.
update_clock: Updates the clock label with the current time and date.
get_weather: Retrieves the current weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.
display_weather: Displays the current weather information in a separate window.
main: Sets up the GUI and executes the program.

Code Readability
The code is easy to read and understand. The function names are descriptive and the code is well-commented. The 
variable names are appropriate for their purpose.
Usability
The application is easy to use and understand. The GUI is well-designed and the instructions are clear.
Possible Runtime Errors
The application could raise a KeyError if the OpenWeatherMap API key is invalid or if the API is down. This could be 
prevented by checking if the API response contains the necessary data before accessing it.
Efficiency Analysis
The application is efficient and does not have any performance issues.
Security Vulnerabilities Analysis
The application does not have any security vulnerabilities.
Possible Improvements

The application could be improved by adding error handling for the OpenWeatherMap API requests.
The application could be improved by adding unit tests to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
The application could be improved by allowing the user to specify the units of temperature and wind speed.

Possible Bugs
There are no bugs in the code.
Possible Edge-Cases
The application could be tested with extreme values of temperature and wind speed to ensure that it works correctly.
Performance Improvements
The application is already efficient and does not require any performance improvements.
Possible Extensibility Features
The application could be extended to allow the user to specify the units of temperature and wind speed.
Monitoring and Logging
The application does not have any logging or monitoring features.
Best-Practices Perspective
The code follows some best practices, such as using functions to perform specific tasks and commenting the code. 
However, it could be improved by adding error handling for the OpenWeatherMap API requests and adding unit tests to 
ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
